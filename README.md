Reflection 1

Clean code principles and secure coding practices that have been applied to my code:
- I have used meaningful variable and function names to make the code more readable and understandable.
- Functions are short and do only one thing.
- Functions that have no side effects.
- Functions do not return null.
- I don't use comments because the code is self-explanatory.
